## Introduction
The launcher itself does not provide the Minecraft client, but you can use it to install any Minecraft version. This guide will show you how to download the game!  

This document is beginner-friendly and avoids advanced operations, so new players can follow along safely.  
For advanced usage, see the following link:

## Downloading the Game
First, we need to enter the download page. There are two ways:

- Through Version Management

- Directly through the Download Page

Once on the download page, it will default to the game version download section, where you can select the Minecraft version you want to play:

After choosing a game version, you'll enter the Add-ons selection page:

At the top, there is a name input box where you can customize the version name.  
The version name helps you identify the version, and the launcher will create a separate folder to store its core files. Therefore, the launcher requires the version name to be unique.  
Once ready, click the Download button at the top:

The launcher will prompt a notification permission dialog:

Notification permission is required to install the game. The launcher uses a foreground service to ensure smooth installation, especially when installing a mod loader later, which significantly increases the success rate.  
You can choose to grant notification permission or skip it. Then the launcher will officially start downloading the game:

After installation, you can see the installed version in Version Management!
