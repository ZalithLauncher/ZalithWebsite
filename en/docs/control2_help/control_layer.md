## Preface

Just like the "layers" feature commonly used in drawing software, you can organize your controls across multiple control layers for better management.

## Creating a Control Layer

In the menu on the right, click the "Create New" button to create a new control layer.

Control layers have a stacking order, they are loaded from bottom to top.  
You can drag and reorder layers as needed.

Each control layer has its own set of properties, which can be used to create powerful and flexible behaviors:
