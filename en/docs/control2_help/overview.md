## Preface

The control layout functions as a layer of virtual buttons, allowing you to interact with the game.  
If you don’t have external peripherals such as a physical keyboard, mouse, or controller and can only play via a touchscreen, you must learn how to use the control layout.

This document is intended for beginners and avoids advanced operations as much as possible — perfect for newcomers!

## Managing Control Layouts

You can open the launcher settings page and find "Control list" in the left navigation bar.  
Click it to enter the control layout management page.

The management page is divided into two sections:  
the left panel lists all control layout files, and the right panel displays detailed information about the currently selected control layout.
