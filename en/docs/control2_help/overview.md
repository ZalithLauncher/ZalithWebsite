## Preface

The control layout functions as a layer of virtual buttons, allowing you to interact with the game.  
If you don’t have external peripherals such as a physical keyboard, mouse, or controller and can only play via a touchscreen, you must learn how to use the control layout.

This document is intended for beginners and avoids advanced operations as much as possible — perfect for newcomers!

## Managing Control Layouts

You can open the launcher settings page and find "Control list" in the left navigation bar.  
Click it to enter the control layout management page.

The management page is divided into two sections:  
the left panel lists all control layout files, and the right panel displays detailed information about the currently selected control layout.

## Creating a New Control Layout

At the top of the left panel, you can find the "Create" button. Click it to open the create control layout dialog.

In the dialog, you must give your control layout a name, which must be within 64 characters.  
The other two fields: "Layout Author" and "Layout Version" are optional and can be left blank.

After clicking the "Create" button, the launcher will generate a new control layout for you.
